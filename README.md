# YouTube Plugin

Modified from bluehex/october-youtube to get a specified list of videos along with statistics, rather than getting videos from a specific channel.

Much of the work is that of the original author and modifications on my part are fairly minimal.

This is developed for my own use on a particular site so probably isn't useful as is.
